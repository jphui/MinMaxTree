# MinMaxTree  TicTacToe AI

**Project Description**

Given skeleton code and documentation that handles TicTacToe game mechanics, create an AI that will rarely lose. Test it by having it play against a human, a random-move bot, and itself.

**Objective**

Understand how to use a tree data structure to generate a MinMax tree that will choose the best move for a TicTacToe player.

**Testing**

Inside the 'server' folder, run the .jar server file and set the port to "1234". Then, run the Lab24ClientRunner.java with exactly one 'a' and one 'b' client configured to preference.
